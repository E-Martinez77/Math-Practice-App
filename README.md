# Math-Practice-App

Development Process

This app initially will be built out using window prompts.

Once all logic is completed it will be fully built out as a full stack project assuming I can get user auth working to create individual user accounts to store progress over time.

## User Story

```
AS AN adult with suboptimal arithmetic skills
I WANT to randomly generate math problems that meet certain criteria
SO THAT I can log hours performing basic calculations to build mental math skills
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a math practice session
WHEN I click the button to generate a math quiz
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for quiz criteria
WHEN prompted for quiz criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the quiz
WHEN prompted for the quiz operation
THEN I choose addition, subtraction, multiplication or division
WHEN prompted for length of the quiz
THEN I choose how many math problems to complete
WHEN I answer each question
THEN my input should be validated and totaled to the score of my quiz
WHEN all questions are answered
THEN I am presented with the total problems against correct answer and percentage of correct answers
```
